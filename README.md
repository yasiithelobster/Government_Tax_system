# Tax Calculation App

This is a Java-based tax calculation application developed as part of my first-year coursework in the BSc (Hons) Artificial Intelligence and Data Science degree at Informatics Institute of Technology. The app calculates taxes based on the details which are in the Tax transactionfile impoerted by the user.

## Features

- Calculate taxes
- Manage tax-related data with proper input validation

## Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 11+ recommended)
- Object-Oriented Programming concepts
- Modular project structure

*Note:* All files inside `src/main` are required for the application to function properly.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Java JDK 11 or higher** installed.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Navigate to the root folder of the project in your terminal.
4. Compile all Java files inside `src/main`:
5. Run the TaxDepartmentApp.java

```bash
javac src/main/*.java
```

## What I Learned
	•	Organizing Java code into multiple classes and packages
	•	Compiling and running Java projects from the command line
	•	Implementing tax calculation logic and validation
	•	Writing clean, maintainable object-oriented code
